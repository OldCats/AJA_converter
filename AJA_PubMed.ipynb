The risk factors can be divided into three categories: preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative. POD is underrecognized, underdiagnosed, and undertreated condition which can lead to potentially life-threatening conditions. Prevention and treatment of POD include adequate perioperative pain control, maintenance of optimal blood pressure, water-electrolyte balance, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, sleep hygiene. Despite POD has been extensively studied in various types of surgery, there is not enough evidence on POD in intracranial neurosurgery. Patients undergoing open craniotomy might be at particular risk because on top of the above-mentioned factors, they also can have a direct neurosurgical brain injury. Future research on the POD in neurosurgical patients after intracranial interventions is needed. A bibliographic search was performed in the MEDLINE and PubMed virtual library. The following descriptors were used: POD, neurosurgery, anesthesia and POD, postoperative pain management and POD, water and electrolyte imbalance and POD, neurochemistry of POD. We included in this review original and review articles in the English language. Majority of non-neurosurgical patients have multiple risk factors for POD (preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative); patients undergoing intracranial neurosurgery might have additional risks associated with neurosurgical pathology (brain tumor, cerebral hemorrhage, and severe traumatic brain injury) as well as neurosurgery-induced brain injury can also appear to be a contributing factor.', 'SP': '5', 'EP': '13', 'LA': '英文', 'SN': '2468-824X', 'UR': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.6859/aja.202003_58(1).0002', 'PB': '台灣麻醉醫學會 & Ainosco Press', 'DO': '10.6859/aja.202003_58(1).0002', 'AU': ['Dmitriy Viderman', 'Evgeni Brotfain', 'Federico Bilotta', 'Agzam Zhumadilov'], 'KW': ['postoperative delirium', 'neurosurgical procedure', 'risk factors', 'neurocritical care']}, {'TY': 'JOUR', 'T1': 'Increase in Intraoperative Urine Output During Tympanoplasty: A Retrospective Cohort Study', 'JO': 'Asian Journal of Anesthesiology', 'VL': '58', 'IS': '1', 'PY': '2020', 'AB': 'Objective: We sometimes encounter cases with unexpected increase in intraoperative urine output during tympanoplasty. However, no previous study has evaluated whether intraoperative urine output during tympanoplasty is higher than that during other surgeries. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the association between tympanoplasty and intraoperative urine output. Methods: This single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted by assessing the records of patients who underwent tympanoplasty, sinus surgery, or thyroidectomy under general anesthesia between April 2013 and March 2017. We defined intraoperative polyuria as a urine output rate of ≥ 2.5 mL/kg/h. The factors associated with high urine output were investigated using multivariable analysis. The influence of tympanoplasty on intraoperative urine output was evaluated after propensity score matching that excluded confounding factors, except the surgical procedure. Results: Intraoperative polyuria occurred in 48 of 173 patients (27.7%) who underwent tympanoplasty. Multivariable analysis revealed that tympanoplasty (p = 0.001), operative time of ≥ 3 h (p = 0.010), and fluid infusion volume of ≥ 5 mL/kg/h (p = 0.029) were risk factors for polyuria. Among the study patients, 100 who underwent tympanoplasty (tympanoplasty group) and 100 who underwent sinus surgery or thyroidectomy (control group) were matched by propensity score analysis. The intraoperative urine output rate was significantly higher in the tympanoplasty group than in the control group (1.2 [0.51-2.20] mL/kg/h vs. 0.70 [0.32-1.60] mL/kg/h, p = 0.010).

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of melatonin on the serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-9 in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Methods: Forty-four patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery were randomly allocated into two study groups of melatonin (n = 23) and placebo (n = 21). Patients in the melatonin group received two melatonin tablet, 5 mg daily for 3 days before surgery, 10 mg tablet (two doses of 5 mg) 1 h before induction of anesthesia and finally, 10 mg melatonin tablet in the intensive care unit, placebo group patients received placebo at the same time periods. Serum levels of IL-9 and IL-6 were measured as baseline (T1), before induction of anesthesia (T2), 6 and 24 h after off pump (T3, T4). Data were analyzed using SPSS 23 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results: The mean serum level of IL-6 was significantly lower in the melatonin group at T3 and T4 (p ＜ 0.05). Also, in both groups, serum levels of IL-6 in T3 showed a significant increase compared to T1. Serum levels of IL-9 had no significant difference between the two groups at T1, T2, T3, and T4.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of melatonin on the serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-9 in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Methods: Forty-four patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery were randomly allocated into two study groups of melatonin (n = 23) and placebo (n = 21). Patients in the melatonin group received two melatonin tablet, 5 mg daily for 3 days before surgery, 10 mg tablet (two doses of 5 mg) 1 h before induction of anesthesia and finally, 10 mg melatonin tablet in the intensive care unit, placebo group patients received placebo at the same time periods. Serum levels of IL-9 and IL-6 were measured as baseline (T1), before induction of anesthesia (T2), 6 and 24 h after off pump (T3, T4). Data were analyzed using SPSS 23 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results: The mean serum level of IL-6 was significantly lower in the melatonin group at T3 and T4 (p ＜ 0.05). Also, in both groups, serum levels of IL-6 in T3 showed a significant increase compared to T1. Serum levels of IL-9 had no significant difference between the two groups at T1, T2, T3, and T4. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that pre-operative melatonin administration could modify inflammatory cytokines secretion such as IL-6 while it has no significant effect on the serum levels of IL- 9. Neither of the changes was clinically significant.</Abstract></Article><Article>\n",

The goal of this study was to evaluate the dynamic trend of the esCCO calibrated with an invasive and non-invasive method. Methods: We retrospectively identified 12 cases with complete data for the two calibration methods. Two calibration methods were analysed and compared with APCO using polar plots. Results: Polar plotting revealed that the mean angular bias was 10.0°, and the radial limit of agreement was 37.1° when calibrated with the invasive method, while the mean angular bias was 3.5°, and the radial limit of agreement was 28.3° with the non-invasive method. Conclusion: This study suggested that the accuracy of a dynamic trend of esCCO may not be affected by the calibration methods, and the esCCO measurement by the non-invasive calibration method may be an effective device similar to that by the invasive calibration method.</Abstract></Article><Article>\n",
